Written for my part II project: "Modelling Hendra virus circulation in eastern Australian flying-foxes", March 2021

SIR model for Hendra virus circulation in eastern Australian flying-fox species (_P. alecto, P. poliocephalus_), with an annual seasonal birth rate, constant death rate, and frequency-dependent transmission.

Annual seasonal birth pulse function developed by Peel et al., 2014, who also fitted the function using a dataset of newborn pups of _P. poliocephalus_ from Gordon, New South Wales (Australia) from 2004-2006 obtained by Peggy Eby.

Plotting functions written for visualising population-level pathogen persistence, either in the form of a CCS estimate (see contourplot) or the distribution of extinction times (see stackedbar - still in writing).
